# Contributing to FLUID: Shape the Standard

Welcome! FLUID is more than a specification—it's a community-driven standard for the future of data. We thrive on collaboration, innovation, and practical solutions. If you want to help define a great standard and solve real problems, you’re in the right place.

## 🚀 Our Philosophy: Build With Us

We believe in a simple, meritocratic process: **good ideas, backed by clear use cases, get in**. Your expertise and creativity can help shape the future of data engineering.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

We keep things lean and effective—no unnecessary bureaucracy.

### 1. Have an Idea? Start the Conversation

- **Big ideas, new features, or breaking changes:**  
    Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/open-data-protocol/fluid/issues) to start a discussion.  
    *Tip: A great proposal explains the “why” as much as the “what.”*

- **Bug fixes, typos, or small improvements:**  
    Skip the issue—just open a Pull Request!

---

### 2. Fork, Code, and Submit a Pull Request

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Make your changes** directly to the specification files.
3. **Add a real-world example.**  
     *Features without clear, practical examples will not be accepted.*
4. **Submit your PR.**  
     Link to your issue if you created one.

### 3. Community Review: Fast, Fair, Focused

Your PR will be reviewed by core contributors and the community. We look for:

- **Alignment with FLUID principles:**  
    Federated, Layered, Unified, Interchange Definition.
- **Clarity and simplicity:**  
    Is it easy to understand and elegant?
- **Real-world impact:**  
    Does it solve an actual problem?

If it’s good, it’s in. We value thoughtful debate and feedback, but we have a strong bias for action.
